* Factory Design Pattern

The factory method is a creational design pattern, i.e., related to object creation. In the Factory pattern, we create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client and the client uses the same common interface to create a new type of object. 

* Singleton Design Pattern

Singleton pattern is a design pattern which restricts a class to instantiate its multiple objects. It is nothing but a way of defining a class. Class is defined in such a way that only one instance of the class is created in the complete execution of a program or project. It is used where only a single instance of a class is required to control the action throughout the execution. A singleton class shouldnâ€™t have multiple instances in any case and at any cost. Singleton classes are used for logging, driver objects, caching and thread pool, database connections.

* Observer pattern

The Observer Pattern defines a one to many dependency between objects so that one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
